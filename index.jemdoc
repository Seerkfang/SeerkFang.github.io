# {{<font color=red size=+0.5>}}I am actively looking for an *internship in summer 2021*. Please feel free to contact me!{{</font>}}


== About me
I am a Ph.D. student in the [https://cse.ucsd.edu/ Department of Computer Science and Engineering] at the [https://www.ucsd.edu/ University of California San Diego], and I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haosu/ Hao Su].
My research interests are broadly in reinforcement learning and concept discovery. 

Prior to starting as a Ph.D. student, I received my B.Eng. and M.Sc. degrees in computer science from [https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/ Zhejiang University], and [https://www.ucsd.edu/ UC San Diego] in 2017 and 2019, respectively.
I have also spent time at [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/ Microsoft Research Asia], [https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/artificial-intelligence/overview.html Intel AI] and [https://research.wormpex.com/ Wormpex AI].

== Research interests
My research interests include 
- Reinforcement Learning
    -- Object-centric RL
    -- Model-based RL
    -- Curriculum in RL
- Concept Discovery
    -- Emergent Concepts in Task Completion
    -- Reasoning over Concepts
